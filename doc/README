YUM::Config version 0.01
=======================

YUM::Config is use to parse a yum.conf file. It downloads remote include
files, or includes local include files. It is able to download mirrorlists
and include it. And it is able to parse the primary.xml.gz.

yum (the 'yellow dog updater modified') is a tool primary used at
Fedora machines to keep the system up2date.

As I was not able to find a module on CPAN, that provides this, so I
had to write my own; And here is it. Have fun with it.
